# TheGamingRoom


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
-The client The Gaming Room, asked us to have their game application, and make it work on different platforms. They asked us to created different methods of authenication for logins, and create a cross platform interface.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- What I did well was seperating the documentation into different parts/requirements of the software. It was a learning expereince writing aboht each part of the paroject each week, such as the client side, server side, memory allocation etc..



What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
-What was helpful was having all the requirements up front and then working to attend each need of the project. Each week was something new, so it was a good way to understand how everything works.



If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-If I could revise anything, I would revise working on the actual code. I had issues getting the software to run and trying to hit each requirement in those suchs. Such as the singleton, and adding the different classes.



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-I interpreted the needs by going over what the requirements were before startibg the project. It is very important to have everything planned out before diving deep into the project. 



How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

-I would use a more indept approach when analying software in the future. Its best to understand how each class works and what everything does before writting a whole documentation about it.
